# Heirloom Toolchest — macOS / Darwin port

A **downstream** Darwin (macOS 26 arm64) port of Gunnar Ritter's
Heirloom **Toolchest**, heirloom-070715 release.

**This repository is not an original work.** It is not an authoritative
source. See `NOTICE.md` and `AI-DISCLOSURE.md` in the repo root for
the full disclosure of provenance, licensing, and AI involvement.

- **Upstream (authoritative):** <http://heirloom.sourceforge.net>
- **Upstream author:** Gunnar Ritter <gunnarr@acm.org> (unmaintained
  since 2008; upstream SourceForge tarballs remain the canonical
  reference)

## Contents

- Commit 1 (`92aa2f5`) — **pristine `heirloom-070715`** upstream tarball,
  extracted verbatim. No source modification.
- All subsequent commits — Darwin port patches, one logical change per
  commit with an inline rationale. See `git log`.

## Building on Darwin

Adjust `mk.config` (or `build/mk.config` for the toolchest) to point at
your desired install prefix (default is `/opt/heirloom`), then `make`.

Refer to the upstream `README` file inside this repository for the
build documentation authored by Gunnar Ritter. The workspace repo
<https://github.com/moonman81/heirloom-workspace-darwin> ships a
top-level Makefile that drives the five packages together.

## Licensing

Per-file, patchwork. See `LICENSE/` (or top-level `LICENSE` file) for
the full set — unchanged from upstream. Port patches inherit their
target file's licence.

## Warranty

**None.** As-is. No guarantee of originality, fitness, or safety. See
`NOTICE.md`.

## Modality — version, variant, dialect

Every installed binary in this port honours a shared help / version /
variant / dialect flag set:

- `--help`, `--usage`, `-H`  → invoke `man(1)` on this tool
- `--version`, `-V`          → port banner (built variant + active variant)
- `--variants`               → list installed personality variants
- `--describe-modality`      → full modality matrix
- `--variant=<name>`, `HEIRLOOM_VARIANT=<name>`, `HEIRLOOM_DIALECT=<name>`
  → re-exec the requested variant
- `HEIRLOOM_PORT_VERSION_REQ=<version>` → pin scripts to a port revision

Recognised variants: `default` (SVID3), `posix` (SUS), `posix2001`
(SUS3), `s42` (SVID4-subset), `ucb` (UCB/BSD), `ccs`.

Recognised dialects: `svid3`, `svr3`, `svr4`, `sysv`, `sysv3`, `posix`,
`sus`, `sus2`, `posix2001`, `sus3`, `s42`, `svid4`, `ucb`, `bsd`, `ccs`.

Full reference: `man 7 heirloom-modality`.

## Extended Heirloom Darwin Port universe

Three additional companion repos extend this port beyond the five
code + one workspace repos:

- <https://github.com/moonman81/heirloom-vi-darwin> — Ritter's ex/vi
  Darwin patches-only scaffold.
- <https://github.com/moonman81/heirloom-citations-darwin> — canonical
  reference documentation (Bell Labs CSTRs, BSTJ 1978, K&R draft).
- <https://github.com/moonman81/heirloom-ancestors-darwin> — manifests +
  notes for the ancestor source code (V7, 32V, DWB 1.0, PWB, PCC, BSDs).
